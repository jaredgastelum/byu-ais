# BYU AIS

This is the official website for the BYU charter of the Association of Information Systems. This website was built with the intention that it would be open source for other students to contriube their ideas, as well as learn about open source software.

I will be adding some new information about the website here.

If you want to contribute, reach out to me at noah@noahjonson.dev
